###OBJECTIVE
 prove to my peer reviewers that the modification to the datasets that I have done meet all the regirements especified on the critiria ([webpage](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project)).

You can see in-depth information about the project on this [zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
###PREREQUISITE
